        <b>Ingredients:</b> <br>
        5 Whole Eggs , boiled <br>
        1 tablespoon Dijon Mustard <br>
        3 tablespoons Classic Mayonnaise <br>
        1 tablespoon Dill leaves , finely chopped <br>
        1 teaspoon Cayenne Pepper <br>
        Salt , to taste<br><br>
        <b>Method:</b> <br>
       1. To begin making Deviled Eggs Recipe with Mayo and Mustard recipe, firstly boil the eggs. <br>
        
      2.  In a pot, add water enough to submerge the eggs completely.<br> For the eggs to get to a hard boiled stage, it'll take up to 10 minutes in boiling water. Turn off the flame
        
      3. Remove the boiled eggs from the hot water and put it in a bowl of cold water or in a bowl of ice cubes.<br> This will help to stop the cooking process and remove the egg shells easily. <br>
        
      4.  De shell the eggs and cut them in half. <br>Scoop out the yolks and put them in a bowl. <br>
        
      5.  Into the bowl containing the yolks, add the dijon mustard, mayonnaise, dill leaves and salt.<br> Mix until it gets to a creamy texture. Taste for seasoning. <br>
        
      6. Add this Mayo Mustard Mixture into a piping bag. <br>If you don't have a piping bag, add this to a thick plastic cover (ones that you get your groceries in), cut off the edge. <br>
        
      7.  Pipe this creamy Mayo Mustard Yolk mixture into the Egg White halves.<br> Once done, refrigerate the Deviled Eggs Recipe for 30 minutes. <br>
        
      8.  Before serving the Deviled Eggs Recipe take them out and garnish with cayenne pepper and freshly chopped dill leaves. <br>
        
      9.  Serve these delicious Deviled Eggs with Mayo and Mustard as a starter at your parties. <br>
