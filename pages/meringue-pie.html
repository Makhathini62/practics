        1large egg yolk<br> <br>
       <b> COOK'S NOTES</b> <br>
        Oven temperatures are for conventional; if using fan-forced (convection), reduce the temperature by 20˚C. <br><br>
      
      <b>  Instructions:</b> <br>
        Chilling time 1 hour <br>
        
        Freezing time 30 minutes <br>
        
        You will also need to allow time for the pastry case and the finished tart to cool completely.<br><br>
        
        1. To make the pastry, using an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix the flour, butter and salt on low speed for about 2-3 minutes or until it becomes a sand-like texture.<br>
        
        2. In the meantime, in a tall container blitz together the icing sugar and egg yolks with a hand blender.<br>
        
        3. Add the vanilla seeds and lemon zest to the egg yolk mixture, and then add to the bowl of the mixer and continue to mix on low speed for about 3-5 minutes or until fully combined and a very soft dough has formed.<br>
        
        4. Mould the dough into a flat rectangle and wrap it in plastic wrap before placing in the fridge for at least 1 hour.<br>
        
        5. Roll the dough between two sheets of baking paper to a thickness of 2 mm, then place in the freezer for 30 minutes.<br>
        
        6. Preheat the oven to 190ºC/gas mark 5.<br> Line a 26 cm tart tin (2.5 cm deep) with the pastry, making sure to press it into the edges and leaving the pastry hanging over the edge.<br> Reserve a little dough for the egg wash.<br>
        
        7. Take a sheet of baking paper and scrunch it up several times to eliminate any sharp edges.<br> Prick the dough with a fork all over the surface. <br>Place the baking paper on top and add enough coins (or baking beans) to fill the casing one-quarter of the way up.<br> Place in the preheated oven to bake for approximately 20 minutes or until fully cooked.<br>
        
        8. In the meantime, mix some of the leftover dough with the egg using a hand blender. <br>
        
        9. After 20 minutes, remove the baking paper and coins and, using a pastry brush, brush the entire surface of the pastry case with the dough and egg mixture.<br> This “liquid pastry” will ensure that any holes will be sealed. Return the pastry case to the oven for an additional 10 minutes. <br>
        
        10. Remove the pastry case from the oven and allow to cool completely.<br>
        
        11.When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 120ºC/gas mark ½. Place the baked pastry case in the oven to warm up.<br>
        
        12. Place all the filling ingredients into a heatproof bowl and mix together using a spatula. <br>Set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water and allow to warm up until the temperature reaches 60ºC.<br> At this point, strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a jug. With a spoon, remove the bubbles from the surface of the liquid.<br>
        
        13. Slide the oven rack out a bit, then pour the mixture into the warm pastry case inside the oven.<br> Fill the case to the top, slide the rack carefully back in, and bake the tart for approximately 25 minutes or until the temperature of the filling reaches 70ºC.<br> Allow to cool completely at room temperature.<br>
        
        14. Just before serving, trim the overhanging pastry by running a sharp knife round the top of the tart tin and discard. <br>
