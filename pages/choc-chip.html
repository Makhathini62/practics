    <p>
        <b>Ingredients:</b> <br>
2 sticks unsalted butter melted but still warm <br>
3/4 cup light brown sugar packed <br>
1/2 cup granulated sugar <br>
1 large egg <br>
2 teaspoons vanilla extract <br>
1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour <br>
2 Tablespoons nonfat dry milk powder <br>
1 and 1/4 teaspoons salt <br>
1/2 teaspoon baking powder <br>
1/4 teaspoon baking soda <br>
1 12 ounce bag semi-sweet chocolate chips <br><br>

Instructions <br>
1. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Line two standard baking sheets with parchment paper
 or silicone mats and set aside. <br>
2. In a large bowl, mix together the melted butter and sugars with a sturdy wooden spoon or rubber spatula.<br> Mix thoroughly until everything is smooth and uniform, about 1 minute.<br>
3. Add in the egg and vanilla and mix by hand for another minute. <br>
4. Add in the flour, dry milk powder, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. <br>Mix until everything comes together, about another minute or so.<br>
5. If your dough appears to be too wet, put the bowl in the refrigerator to firm up.<br>
6. Using a cookie scoop, scoop mounds of dough onto your prepared baking sheets, allowing at least 2-3 inches between each cookie mound.<br>
7. Bake in your preheated oven for 5 minutes, then rotate the pans front to back and top to bottom.<br> Bake another 5-6 minutes or until the cookies are golden brown. <br>The middles may appear to be underdone, and that is OK. <br>
8. Allow the cookies to cool and firm up before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.<br><br>
<b>Notes <br>Cookies should be stored in an airtight container and will keep for several days. </b>
