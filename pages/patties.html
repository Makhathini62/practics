        <p>
            <b>Ingredients:</b> <br>
            1 tbsp vegetable oil 1 onion, finely chopped<br>
3 large garlic cloves, crushed<br>
3 tsp mild curry powder 3 tbsp finely sliced chives<br>
2 tbsp chopped thyme leaves<br>
250g mixed diced vegetables (a mixture of sweetcorn, carrots, peas and peppers is great)<br>
100ml vegetable stock 1 tsp brown sugar<br>
1-2 tsp hot pepper sauce (optional)<br>
1 slice of any bread of your choice (about 60g), torn into small pieces 500g block shortcrust pastry plain flour, for dusting<br>
1 tsp ground turmeric<br>
1 egg, beaten<br><br>
<b>Method:</b> <br>

1. Heat the oil in a deep saucepan over a medium heat and cook the onion with a small pinch of salt for 8-10 mins, stirring regularly until softened.<br> Add the garlic, 2 tsp of the curry powder and the herbs, and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.<br>
2. Add the mixed vegetables, stock, sugar and hot pepper sauce, if using. <br> Turn the heat up to high, bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the the heat to low, cover and simmer for about 10 mins.<br> Add the bread, then continue to simmer over a low heat for another 8-10 mins, stirring occasionally until thickened.<br> Taste for seasoning and leave to cool. <br>
3. Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured surface to a 5mm thickness.<br> Stamp out 16-20 circles (about 8cm in diameter) using a biscuit cutter, then spoon the cooled filling over one half of each pastry circle.<br> Fold the other half of the pastry over to enclose the filling and create a semi-circle then crimp the edge with a fork to seal.<br> To freeze, put the patties on a baking tray lined with baking parchment and open-freeze until solid.<br> Transfer to a freezer bag and freeze for up to two months.<br> Defrost in the fridge overnight before using or bake the patties from frozen.<br>
4. Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan. Arrange the patties on a baking tray lined with baking parchment.<br> Whisk the turmeric and remaining 1 tsp curry powder into the beaten egg, then brush this over the patties. <br> Bake for 18-20 mins (or 25 mins from frozen) until the pastry is golden and cooked through, then serve immediately. <br>
