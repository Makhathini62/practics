        <h1><b>MORE ABOUT CHICKEN-MUSHROOM RISOTTO RECIPE</b></h1>
        <img src="../images/chicken-mushroom-risotto.jfif" >
        <p><b>Ingredients:</b> <br>
            50g butter<br>
            85g smoked bacon lardons<br>
            1 large onion, halved and finely chopped<br>
            250g chestnut mushrooms, thickly sliced<br>
            300g arborio risotto rice<br>
            150ml dry white wine<br>
            1.4l hot chicken stock<br>
            140g cooked chicken, chopped<br>
            50g grated parmesan, plus extra to serve (optional)<br>
            ½ small pack of flat-leaf parsley, chopped <br><br>
            <b>Method: </b><br>
STEP 1 <br>
Heat the butter in a large pan.<br> Add the lardons and fry for 5 mins over a low-medium heat.<br> Stir in the onion and fry for 10 mins more until the onion is soft but not coloured.<br>

STEP 2 <br>
Stir in the mushrooms and continue cooking, stirring, for 5 mins.<br> Stir in the risotto rice and cook over a medium heat for 2 mins until the rice has started to turn translucent. <br>
            STEP 3  <br>
Pour in the wine and allow it to bubble away over the heat. <br> Pour in a quarter of the chicken stock and set a timer for 20 mins. <br>

STEP 4 <br>
Continue cooking, stirring very frequently, topping up with a splash more stock as it gets absorbed – this is best done in three more stages, until the rice is cooked and most of the stock has been absorbed (you may not need all the stock). <br> The texture now should be creamy, like rice pudding. <br>

STEP 5  <br>
Stir through the chicken, warm briefly, then turn off the heat. <br> Stir through the parmesan and parsley, cover and leave to rest for 5 mins to allow more liquid to be absorbed into the rice. Season to taste and serve with extra parmesan, if you like.
