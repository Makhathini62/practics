    <p>
        <b>Ingredients:</b><br>
        1 lb ball pizza dough <br>
1/2 cup pizza sauce <br>
1 cup shredded cheese <br>
1 medium roma tomato <br>
3 oz ham <br>
4 large eggs <br>
2 sliced green onions<br> 
1 Tbsp cornmeal <br>
as needed non-stick spray or little oil<br><br> 
        <b>Method:</b><br>
        If using frozen pizza dough, allow it to come to room temperature before stretching it into shape (it is much more cooperative at room temp).<br>  While the dough is thawing, slice the tomato, green onion and dice the ham.<br>
        Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Spray or put a little bit of oil in a perforated pizza pan with non-stick spray.<br> Stretch the dough into a 16 inch round and place on the pizza pan.<br>
        Top the pizza with sauce, half of the cheese, the tomatoes, ham, green onions, eggs and the remaining half of the cheese.<br> The eggs can either be placed on top whole and raw or pre-scrambled and sprinkled over top.<br>
        Bake the pizza for about 15 minutes at 450 degrees or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted.
